# personalWebsite

This is my first website I have made using everything I have learned from Unit 1 at Fullstack Academy.
In this project I use my basic understanding of .html, .css, and .js to create a 3 page website.

Update 1: In this update a contact page has been added to my website. Along with improves styling and new coding techniques I have learned.
